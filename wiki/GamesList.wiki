Go to IdeaOfProtocol to remember what is *caption*, what is *data* and so on.

==Request==

Client sends protocol message to server with next caption:

||Caption pseudo name||identificator(int)||
||GAMES_LIST_MESSAGE_ID||20||

The data of message must be empty. _Anyway data will be ignored_

==Response==

_Currently this command is availiable in all client states, but in next releases it would be availiable only in "Not joined" state._

If there is no unstarted games on server then response looks like this:
    GAMES_LIST_MESSAGE_ID - caption

    "No unstarted games finded." - only element in data.
Else:
    GAMES_LIST_MESSAGE_ID - caption

    //TODO write description of how games are sending...
