where gN - gameName is game name.
      mN - mapName  is map name(must exist in server) For ex: for 1.map command would be "1 gameName 1 -1"

             int int int ... int      -ints of map. Each line of map on next line
             int int int ... int
             ...................
             int int int ... int       
             int   -ammount of explosion squares. If no no explosion squares here would be zero!!!
             intX intY         
             ...          - coordinates of explosion squares
             intX intY
